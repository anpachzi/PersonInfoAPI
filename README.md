How to use:

When the app is runing, put http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser of choice and the app should appear in your browser. 

If you are using Docker the port number may be diffrent. Check which port is being used and replace the localhost: http://localhost:XXXX/index.html (the XXXX is the port number that you need to change to whatever you have in Docker)
